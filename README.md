Privacy Policy. 

For our project, we are only asking for public information from the Instagram API, and only from classmates of ours that have given us permission to use their Instagram accounts to perform network analysis. None of this information will be sold or otherwise used for commercial purposes, the use of this public data is simply for educational purposes only. Results will only be presented in a very restricted classroom setting.
